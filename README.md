# autoLesson
autoLesson.py is simple python script that i was developing for attending lessons without user intraction. I will explain: in my university few professors threatened us with lower grades
if we do not attend all lectures, but how can one attend lecture, where sound coming from professor’s microphone could make your ears bleed in a fraction of second. 
That’s how I came up with an idea of a script that could enter lesson at given time and exit not to rise suspicion. 
### However
However, term was coming to an end and professors’ words turned out to be bluff. That’s why I stopped developing. I could continue working on it, if fall term will be online.
